This is an AoC API aimed to provide Bebots !items commands interactivity.

If you don't want to host your own copy, you can use Bebot's default settings.
Otherwise you'll need Apache/PHP + Bebot & its SQL DataBase to make this work properly.
Once your Bebot & Apache run fine, just edit local init.php accordingly to created DB.
Then execute this script just once to initialize its following "itemdb_..." tables :
_bots
 Which is remembering allowed bot(s) with respective Passkey
_items
 Which records added items from various ingame requests
_recipes
 Which links various items to remind existing recipes
_recipe_crafters
 Which reminds which player shares recipe datas
Finally, insert (manually or by PhpMyAdmin) pairs of Botname with Passkey in _bots table.

The API consists of the 4 following "itemdb_..." pathes :
_botrecipesearch
 Which allows you to search among recipes stored in the DB
_botrecipesubmit
 Which lets you add some recipes in the DB (if not known already)
_botsearch
 Which welcomes you to search among items stored in the DB
_botsubmit
 Which permits you add some items in the DB (if not known already)

Now you'd just have to set your bot up to start feeding your DB from ingame.
Settings are detailed here http://wiki.bebot.link/index.php/Items.php
